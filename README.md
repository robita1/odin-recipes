# odin-recipe
introduction
this project is a straightforward recipe website featuring three distinct dishes: lasagna, garlic shrimp, and mint chicken. It incorporates fundamental HTML elements such as boilerplate structure, headings, paragraphs, unordered and ordered lists, as well as image integration and page linking. Users can easily navigate to the recipe pages for each dish: lasagna.html, garlic-shrimp.html, and mint-chicken.html.Throughout the project, I showcased skills in directory and file management, content creation including images and text, and structuring lists for ingredients and steps.

In addition to demonstrating skills in HTML and web development, this project also showcases proficiency in using Git and GitHub. From creating and organising directories to adding files using linux Git commands like git add, staging, committing them with git commit, and finally pushing them to the GitHub repository.
